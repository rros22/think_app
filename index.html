        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Think App (“the App”) is designed to operate primarily on your device.
          The App does not collect, store on external servers, sell, or share
          personal data.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
          We do not collect any personal information or usage data. This
          includes (but is not limited to) your name, email address, device
          identifiers, location, contact lists, photos, analytics, advertising
          identifiers, or crash reports.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Data Storage (On-Device Only)</h2>
        <p>
          The App uses internal (local) device storage to save app settings and
          preferences needed for functionality (for example, feature
          configuration and local state).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This information stays on your device.</li>
          <li>
            The App does not transmit this information to us or third parties.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you delete the App, locally stored data is typically removed by
            the operating system.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. NFC Usage</h2>
        <p>
          The App may use Near Field Communication (NFC) features to enable
          interactions that require NFC capability.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            NFC data is processed on-device for the purpose of enabling the
            requested feature.
          </li>
          <li>The App does not store NFC scan results on external servers.</li>
          <li>The App does not share NFC-related data with third parties.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Screen Time and Device Controls</h2>
        <p>
          The App may support Screen Time-related controls (e.g., helping you
          manage or limit app usage) using Apple-provided system frameworks and
          permissions where applicable.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Any configuration is stored locally on your device.</li>
          <li>
            We do not receive Screen Time data and do not access it beyond what
            is required for the feature to function on-device.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          The App does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising SDKs,
          data brokers, or external tracking services.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this changes in the future, this policy will be updated before such
          services are enabled.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
          Because the App does not collect data, there is no child-specific data
          processing.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We take reasonable steps to keep the App’s on-device data handling
          minimal and aligned with platform security best practices. However, no
          method of storage is 100% secure, and device security ultimately
          depends on your device settings and environment.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
        <p>
          Because the App does not collect data, there is typically nothing to
          access, export, or delete from our systems. You can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Remove local app data by deleting the App.</li>
          <li>
            Control system permissions (including NFC and Screen Time
            permissions, where applicable) through your device settings.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App or
          legal requirements. The “Effective date” will be updated accordingly,
          and the latest version will be made available on our website.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
